      <description>Today is the first day of this personal website, which I chosen to develep with Hugo.
A while a go, had the opportunity to work with Jekyll, developing a yet to come, new version for my parents small scale tourist resort, Quinta da Rica-Fe.
After working with both Hugo and Jekyll, I decided that I will migrate also to Hugo my parents website. The main reasons for this are:
 Compile time, Hugo is really fast comparing with the alternative.</description>
